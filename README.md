Hey, great you're here :)

I'm @kevin-michael, physisist, hobby coder and engineer, linux enthusiast and lazy enough to automate 
useless tasks in just about tripple the time it would've taken.

In my free time I learn about cyber security, flutter development and sometimes AI too. 
Allways trying to improve my C++ skills of course! Other from that I'm pretty fluent in python
I'd say, but who am I to judge. 

My public repos are pretty lame, sorry for that, but most of the times I am to lazy to actually use git for smaller projects and my gems are usually staying private. 

Have a good one! -K
