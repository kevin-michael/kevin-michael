Hey, great you're here :)

I'm @kevin-michael, physisist, hobby engineer, linux enthusiast and lazy enough to automate 
useless tasks in just about tripple the time it would've taken.

In my free time I learn about cyber security, physical simulations and sometimes AI too. 
Allways trying to improve my C++ skills of course! Other from that I'm pretty fluent in python
I'd say, but who am I to judge. 

On my profile you'll find some of my poorly styled after work projects, or more like those where I
wasn't to lazy to create a git repo. 

Have a good one! -K
